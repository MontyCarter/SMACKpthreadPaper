\chapter{Model Design}\label{ch:modeldesign}
[This paragraph is very poorly written, and only serves as a general idea of how I'll introduce the chapter]

I'm going to talk about the general concerns and techniques that I've learned for modeling concurrency, using my implementation of pthreads support in SMACK to demonstrate.  To facilitate this, this chapter begins with an introduction to the modeling environment that comprises SMACK.  Having introduced this, the chapter proceeds to discuss the process of modeling concurrency over the lifecycle of a thread of execution.

\section{Modeling Environment}
[Again, poorly written - just to organize thoughts]
As described in Chapter~\ref{ch:background}, SMACK consumes LLVM IR bytecode, builds a model of the input program, and generates a Boogie IVL file.  It turns out that the final pthread implementation is written largely using C code, which then gets converted into the Boogie IVL model of pthreads within each translated input program.

To ease the discussion of the modeling process, I'll briefly introduce Boogie IVL, the Corral concurrency primitives, as well as some helper functions defined at the C/C++ level that inject Boogie statements into the translated Boogie code.

\subsection{Boogie IVL}
The most illustrative way to introduce Boogie IVL may be to show an input C program and the relevant portions of the Boogie output that SMACK returns.

\begin{lstlisting}


void main() {
  int *x, *y;
  x = malloc(sizeof(int));
  y = malloc(sizeof(int));
  *x = 1;
  *y = 2;
  assert(*x == 1);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=boogie]
var $M: [int]int;

procedure main() {
  var $x, $y: int;
  call $x := $malloc(4);
  call $y := $malloc(4);
  $M[$x] := 1;
  $M[$y] := 2;
  assert($M[$x] == 1);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Boogie Code from SMACK}\label{fig:cToBoogie_b}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{C Input to Boogie Code}\label{fig:cToBoogie}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:cToBoogie_b} shows a reduced version of the Boogie code as translated by SMACK from the input source depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:cToBoogie_a}.  Notice that dynamic memory allocation on the heap is modeled with a global array of \lstinline|int|s [fix color here, or don't use lstinline].  Dereferencing pointers simply becomes indexing into the array representing the heap.

\subsection{Corral Concurrency Primitives}\
Corral is a back-end solver that verifies Boogie IVL programs.  One of Corral's recent development efforts has been to improve support for verifying concurrent programs.  To this end, Corral has extended Boogie IVL, and recognizes five concurrency primitives that are not part of the base language.  These are [choose whether to list here or in background]:


\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|async call| \emph{func}\lstinline|(|\emph{...}\lstinline|)| - Asynchronously calls \emph{func} with the parameter list \emph{'...'}
\item \lstinline|corral_atomic_begin()| - Begins an atomic block
\item \lstinline|corral_atomic_end()| - Ends an atomic block
\item \lstinline|corral_getThreadID()| - Returns the ID of the calling thread.
\item \lstinline|corral_getChildThreadID()| - Returns the ID of the thread most recently spawned in the calling procedure.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}[language=boogie]
var $x: int;

procedure f() 
  modifies $x;
{
  var $tid: int;
  call $tid := corral_getThreadID();
  call corral_atomic_begin();
  $x := $tid;
  assert($x == $tid);
  call corral_atomic_end();
}

procedure main() {
  var $ch1, $ch2: int;
  $x := 0;
  async call f();
  $ch1 := corral_getChildThreadID();
  async call f();
  $ch2 := corral_getChildThreadID();
  assert($x == $ch1 || $x == $ch2);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Corral Concurrency Primitive Usage Example}

[Fix this god-awful caption]

Figure~\ref{fig:corralprimitives} demonstrates the usage of each of these primitives within the context of a complete Boogie program.

\section{Thread Creation}

\section{Locking Primitives}
These primitives are fairly straightforward, but there are a few gotchas.  The biggest one is [I am so tired and writing so poorly] that support for atomic sections is implemented as one single global lock.  

Of all sections of code enclosed in an atomic begin/end block, only one can be executing at any given time.  This means using the Corral atomic primitives alone, there is no way to create multiple mutual exclusion mechanisms.
