I would like to thank my wife for being the persistent support and
advocate that she is, and for tolerating my dismaying schedule as I
completed this research project. 

I would also like to thank my advisor, Zvonimir RakamariÄ‡, for
encouraging me, inspiring me, and motivating me. 

Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to mention my parents, who have
given me a curiosity about the world and an enjoyment of learning, as
well ensuring that I never set my sights too low.
