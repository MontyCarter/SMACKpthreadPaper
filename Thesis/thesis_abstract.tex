SMACK is a static analysis tool for C/C++ programs.  Although SMACK is
an active project with support from both academia and industry, it
currently lacks support for any form of concurrency.  This paper
introduces a recent implementation of an extension to SMACK that
provides support for the verification of programs utilizing the
pthread library.  It first discusses the design of a model that
captures the behavior of the pthread libarary.  Next, it details the
implementation of the model within the SMACK framework.  Finally, it
explores an empirical evaluation of the implementation that
demonstrates its efficacy in verifying programs that utilize the
pthread library.
