SMACK is a static analysis tool for C/C++ programs.  Although SMACK is an active project with support from both academia and industry, it currently lacks support for any form of concurrency.  The proposed research will extend SMACK to include support for a common subset of the Pthreads API.  In addition to extending SMACK, the proposed research will result in an examination of the generic constructs useful for modeling general concurrency within the context of model checking and symbolic execution.
