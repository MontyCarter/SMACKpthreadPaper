\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}
[No good ideas on how to start this chapter...  Note to self - the
quality of my writing suffers when I get too tired...  Will use
something simple as a placeholder]
Having designed the model for the pthread library extension to SMACK,
[wc it becomes time to] package it up and implement as a new feature
for SMACK.

In this chapter I provide an overview on the details of implementing
the new pthread model within SMACK.  [Barf]  

\section{SMACK Modification?}
[Do a section here on init funcs?]

\section{[wc Include Mechanism]}
[Describe how pthread.h is included, and preempts normal pthread.h.]
[Discuss problem with pthreadtypes.h being included by other headers?]

\section{[wc Implemented Functionality]}
[describe target as most commonly occurring calls in svcomp, inspect,
civl, benchmarks]

[List implemented function calls]

[List remaining low hanging fruit, also function calls that really
should be implemented but aren't]
